# fbtm-action

**ðŸš§ THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.**

This is the GitHub action powering the [fbtm](https://github.com/brxxn/fbtm) repository.

This README is still a work in progress, but it will get done eventually!

Temporary info for people trying to contribute:

- Searches are located in `src/fbtm/search/types/` and need to be put in the `registry.ts`
- Commands are located in `src/fbtm/command/types/` and also need to be put in their registry
- After making any changes, you need to `npm run build` (need to create a hook that does this automatically)
